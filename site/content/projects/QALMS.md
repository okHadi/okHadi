A Flask-based web application that aggregates academic information from NUST's QALAM and LMS portals into a single dashboard. Features automated login and web scraping to display course grades, attendance, timetables, assignments, mess invoices, and teacher contact information in one unified interface. Built as a university project to simplify student access to fragmented academic data.
